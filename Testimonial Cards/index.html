      <p>
        Since starting my career in 2021, I have only followed one resource, roadmap.sh. 
        It truly helped me go from 0 to having a job and changing the financial trajectory of my family.

        I find myself recommending roadmap.sh to all the internees or junior developers. 
        It's a great way to skill up and grow in your career.

        roadmap.sh is an incredible resource. I was fortunate to discover it during my university days in 2018. 
        Back then, it was just a single repository with three images. It's amazing to see how much impact it has had 
        on millions of lives since then.
