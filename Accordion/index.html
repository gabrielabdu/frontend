        What are Neural Networks?
        <span class="arrow">▼</span>
      </button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        Neural Networks are computational models inspired by the human brain. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information and detect complex patterns in data.

        What is Deep Learning?
        <span class="arrow">▼</span>
      </button>
      <div class="accordion-content">
        Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning that uses large neural networks with many layers (deep architectures) to analyze and learn from large volumes of data, especially images, text, and speech.
